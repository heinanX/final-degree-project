**Today I worked on** 
worked on my presentation - 6h 30min
404 page - 2h
Cart bug - 15 min
fixed clear cart upon purchase, added navlink to 'return to home' button - 30min


**A lot of time was spent** wrestling myself with how I wanted to store the admin state. I put a lot of time into researching different ways but eventually I deemed a better solution as more time consuming, than benefitial, so I settled on just saving the isAdmin boolean in a state, client side. It's not particularly secure but all my end points have authorization from server side so, even if a user hypothetically could make their way into the admin interface, they can't really do anything. They aren't allowed into sensitive information such as customer information either.
