**Today I worked on**
- writing middlewares for stripe:
    deleteCustome,
    updateCustomer,
    createProduct,
    archiveProduct,
    editProduct
- authorize function
- authenticate function
- add logic to user,
- add to schema user
- add to schema product
- test endpoints
EST total time - 6 hours each

**Today I've learned more about** how to create a customer or product in my own database, and at the same time create or update it in Stripe.


**A problem I had** was constructing the authorize function. I kept writing it wrong so that it contradicted itself, but by splitting the if statements (and just importing the isAdmin middleware) solved it for me.
