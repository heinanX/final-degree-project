# START OF SPRINT 2

**I started off by** writing my retrospective. I took a snapshot of my project board and contemplated over my progress from last week in a text file.

**Today I worked on** 
- github upload error handling - 15min
- middleware: format Data to lower case - 1h
- category CRUD - 1h
- Product Schema start: 12:36

**While working** I realized that I had not done a joi schema for the address array inside user schema, so I added another list to my project board in trello called review. This is where I add items that has to be reviewed, rewritten, or edited in some other way.

**A problem I had** was that I had mistakenly uploaded to github my credentials to my database in the connection string to the server. I fixed this by including the credentials in an .env file.
