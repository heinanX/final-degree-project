**Today I worked on** 
product details for admin and also editing a product - 16h
user orders - 1h


**A lot of time was spent** typing up types that matched and getting the states to update correctly. I'm not particularly proud of the structure of the code, but it works and I'll have to leave it at that. Had I had more time or done this before I could've planned the data flow better, as it is now, order and product does not share the same logic. I wanted to see if there was another way of doing it and like always it ended up taking so much longer than I intended it too. I've spent almost 6 days on this little feature, aaaand I had originally calculated it to take about 2 days.

I've decided to leave the add product feature because I seriously don't have time to connect it. I need to focus on fetching a logged in users orders, set a number for products in cart, and about another 1000 things that's dragging behind.
