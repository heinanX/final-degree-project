**Today I worked on**
error handler research - 1h
error handler - 10min
error handler commenting - 5min
authenticate login - 50min


**Today I've learned more about** error handling. I used an error handler I had from another project, but I didn't really remember what it all meant since it was done so early in our education and I've just been using it ever since. But that took me down another route where I learned more about classes, Express and object oriented programming.
