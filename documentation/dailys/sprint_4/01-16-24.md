**Today I worked on** 
- cart context and creating cart - 5h


**A problem I had** was typing the default values for the cart state. It threw me in an endless loop of error messages that the default values did not match the context and that the properties did not exist on its interface. It was quite frustrating and I rewrote the interface, default values multiple times and when finally something worked, my functions threw errors instead and it was hard to reach the information inside the state. It's at times like these that you wonder why you're even bothering with it, but I pushed through, and hours later I finally have a state that works. For now.
