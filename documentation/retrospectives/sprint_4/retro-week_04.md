# RETROSPECTIVE 4


**A major challenge** was that I had not really done a plan for my frontend and that ended up biting me in the b-hind. I had my wireframe and a general look, ut the pages still take time to put together.

Another challange have been TypeScript. I got stuck on interfaces for so many hours just becase it threw me in a loop of errors, but handling all those errors have given me a better understandning for types and how it is handled. I managed to write a Cart interface that I couldn't at the beginning of the week.

**I made an addition to my project board** by adding a card for the Order confirmation page. I had not really included that in my project plan.

**My being behind** is now more than I was the week before. I have some stuff dragging behind, but I'm gonna give it my all and hopefully I'll catch up now since the hardest parts are over. However knowing my luck, I'll prolly get stuck on something mundane.
