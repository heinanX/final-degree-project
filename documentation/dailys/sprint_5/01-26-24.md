**Today I worked on** 
commenting code and restructuring files - 4h 


**A lot of time is spent** restructuring and/or reviewing code right now. I guess it's because, at first, I thought I had a clear idea of what I needed, but as the project grows, so do the components and functions and what I thought was well-organized and structured from the beginning ends up being confusing or needing more reviewing.

Because I'm in school, I feel like this is a time to test what works best for me, but sometimes I think sticking to what I know works best would be more efficient and less hard on me. And since we are short on time for this project, I should really hold myself back a little.

But it's so hard... I'm great at following schedules, it's making them that's hard.
