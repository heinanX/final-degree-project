**Today I worked on** 
- addToCart function refinements and added logic- 1h
- handleQuantity - 1h
- calcTotalCart - 1h
- handleCheckout - 1h
- CheckoutPage - 3h
- Cart additions - 1h


**A problem I had** was getting the checkout session in stipe to function, I knew it was something I was doing wrong, because it worked back when I built my backend. After some rewriting of cart and running a new js compilation of my backend the problem got sovled.
