**Today I worked on** assuring my connection between server and database.

connection to db: 90min
isAdmin validation: 150 minutes - mostly research.

**A problem I had** was that TypeScript kept throwing an error that .isAdmin was not a property of req.session and thus crashing the server. I had estimated this initial task to take about 5 minutes, since it only needs to check session data but because I was serving out TS instead of serving out the compiled JS build, the TS render failed to fetch the data from my declaration file for express-sessions and thus my interface for the isAdmin property was not present when starting the server.
