**Today I worked on**
adding to my project board
customer context - 1h 30min
signup form - 1h
login form - 45min
isloggedin logic - 1h
authenticate login status - 15min
re-naming files - 2h
created products - 3h


**Project board additions:** I realized I had forgotten completely about creating a customer context, and order context. So I added the former to this weeks planning, and the latter to next week.
