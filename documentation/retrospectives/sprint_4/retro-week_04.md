# RETROSPECTIVE 4

**Last week's sprint** 

**A major challenge** was that I had not really done a plan for my frontend and that ended up biting me in the b-hind. I had my wireframe and a general look, ut the pages still take time to put together.

Another challange have been TypeScript. I got stuck on interfaces for so many hours just becase it threw me in a loop of errors, but handling all those errors have given me a better understandning for types and how it is handled. I managed to write a Cart interface that I couldn't at the beginning of the week.

**I made an addition to my project board** by adding a card for the Order confirmation page. I had not really included that in my project plan.

**My being behind**
