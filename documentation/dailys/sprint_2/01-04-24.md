**Today I worked on**
- payment integration documentation - 2h
- integrating stripe as a payment method - 4h
- rewriting createCustomer function to include stripe, then splitting stripe logic into its own middleware - 1h
- created users in db and on stripe - 30 min

**Today I've learned more about** different payment methods. I looked into using Payson, but because that had to be designed (or at least the freebie version from what I reckon), I went with Stripe. I have considered PayPal, but that one needed an account, and I'm not super fond of having 80 different accounts everywhere. Furthermore, I have only assigned two days for the payment integration so there is always time to consider. That being said, I might add it at a later point in the project if I get the time.

I don't want to bite off more than I can chew.
