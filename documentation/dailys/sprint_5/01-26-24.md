**Today I worked on** 
order context - 5min
edit orders - 6h 40min
more view single order - 3h
even more edit orders - 3h


**Today I worked on** viewing one order and then editing that order. It's a component heavy feature and I find myself rewriting logic both in backend as in my frontend. I'm laying the ground work for products though, so I don't think that will take as long. I am also careful to make it responsive so that I dont have to do that later on. I'm running out of time.
