**Today I worked on** 
user vs. admin logic - 6h
authorization 1 - 1h
cart indicator - 2h
fetching products based on criteria - 2h
commentary - 2h


**A lot of time was spent** wrestling myself with how I wanted to store the admin state. I put a lot of time into researching different ways but eventually I deemed a better solution as more time consuming, than benefitial, so I settled on just saving the isAdmin boolean in a state, client side. It's not particularly secure but all my end points have authorization from server side so, even if a user hypothetically could make their way into the admin interface, they can't really do anything. They aren't allowed into sensitive information such as customer information either.
