**Today I worked on** 
user vs. admin logic - 6h
authorization 1 - 1h


**A lot of time is spent** wrestling myself of how I wanted to store the admin state. Eventually I settled on just saving the boolean in a state. It's not particularily secure but all my end points have validation from server side so, even if a user hypothetically could make their way into the admin interface, they can't really do anything. They are not allowed into sensitive information such as customer information.
