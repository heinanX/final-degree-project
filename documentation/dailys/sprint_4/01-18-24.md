**Today I worked on** 
- changed route when displaying a product - 4h
- error logged faulty category and tag fetches 

**A problem I had** was when I modified the route from /:id to /products/:id. Which lead to my fetch requests within the getProduct function for fetching categories and tags to fail. Upon examining the error logs, I discovered that I had neglected to include a forward slash (/) before my API call. This oversight resulted in my fetch calls using an incorrect URL.
