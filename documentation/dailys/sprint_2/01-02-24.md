# START OF SPRINT 2

**I started off by** writing my retrospective. I took a snapshot of my project board and contemplated over my progress from last week in a text file.

**Today I worked on** 
-middleware: format Data to lower case

**A problem I had** Was that I had mistakenly uploaded to github my credentials to my database in the connection string to the server. I fixed this by including the credentials in an .env file.
