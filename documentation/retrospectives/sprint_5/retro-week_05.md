# RETROSPECTIVE 4

**A major challenge** was finishing the admin part of the customer page. I had calculated that to take half a day each [order and products] but it ended up taking more than the double. 

**My being behind** is still a fact as I enter the last sprint of this project. I have the rest of today and tomorrow to complete the things I haven't done yet, and also add commentary to my code. There will be things I won't have time to complete before I turn this project in. I might go back in the future and finish what I didn't have time to finish now. I will however be done with all the things I set out to do in this project, and for that I am happy.
