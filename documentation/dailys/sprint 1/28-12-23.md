# LOGG

**Today I worked on** setting up my VideoShack's server file and folder structure. I also set up the server, database and connected the two, thus enabling me to focus on writing the logic for customer tomorrow.

**A problem I had** was that I was working on my mac. I have never used MongoDB on that one so I had to install it which was a lot more complicated than it had been on my PC.
