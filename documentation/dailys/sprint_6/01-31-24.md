**Today I worked on** 
added commentary - 2h 30min
clean up 1h
order success page - 2h
isLogin check bug - 2h


**A lot of time was spent** adding commentary to my code. I kept forgetting it as I was writing the components, so I had to go through the whole client folder. And I still have server left.
I did some minor clean up and fixed some TS errors and I also rewrote some of the parts in OrderSuccess page. It looked rather bleh, so I added some margin, structure and responsitivity. It's still not very good, but less bad anyways. lol.

Another head scratcher moment was the isLoggedIn state. I realized that when I went straight to an endpoint [i.e /checkout] it didn't log isLoggedIn as true, but rather false because of the execution time, thus it didn't redirect an anonymous user from checkout or account page. It also didn't recognize that a user was logged in and a logged in user could still go to '/login'. So I added a state that checks if isLoggedIn is loading, and once it's done or has recieved a 200 ok response, it sets the loading state to false.
