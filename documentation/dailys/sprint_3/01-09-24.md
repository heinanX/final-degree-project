**Today I worked on**
- wireframe frontend - 1h
- research Next.js 13 - 2h
- setup vite project - 30min
- setup routing and 'main components' - 30min
- Hero - 2h
- Header - 30min


**Today I've learned more about** Next.js 13. I had initially thought about building the frontend with Next.js, but because I felt I had to research more, and I'm already behind on schedule, I decided to build a Vite project instead. I do appreciate its speed and TypeScript support, which have proven to be valuable assets for efficient development and improved code maintainability.
