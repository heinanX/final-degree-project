# RETROSPECTIVE 2


**Last week's sprint** was focused on creating CRUDs for product, order, tags and categories. I also integrated a payment method using stripe.

**A major challange** 

**I added some functions**  

**I made an addition to my project board** by introducing a section titled 'In Need of Review.' This will serve as a space for reminders where I have to edit my code, but it's not critical.
