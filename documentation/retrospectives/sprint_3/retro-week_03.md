# RETROSPECTIVE 2

**Last week's sprint** focused on creating the frontend, more specifically the folder and file structure and the front page. That included user login and cart in the header.

**A minor challenge** was to keep it simple and leave things "okay". I tend to spend too much time styling stuff, or going deeper than I have to, and like always I did so when I started on the frontend. Because I was already behind I fell even more behind when I got stuck on trying to create products through my frontend. Eventually I had to realize I had to let it go and things started moving more smoothly.

**I made an addition to my project board** by adding cards for order and context schema. Going back to my backend I also noticed that my Stripe middleware that updates a product is not working correctly, so I added that to the 'In need of review' card.

**My being behind** set me back throughout the whole week, I also had to work at my normal job, so I had to work during the weekend, but it payed off and I'm more on schedule now. I'm confident, come Friday and I'll be ahead of my schedule.

My mantra this week is "Let it go", lol
