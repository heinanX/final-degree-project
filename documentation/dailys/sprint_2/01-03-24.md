**I started off by** wapping up the rest of products. I also wrote the logic for edit Product.

**Today I worked on** 
- order CRUD - 6h

**Today I've learned more about CRUD** by rewriting all my functions inside the controller. By doing that and not just copying pasting my previous functions, I'm able to reasses the the previous code, improve it and write more efficent code.
