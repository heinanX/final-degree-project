# START OF SPRINT 1

**Today I worked on** setting up a trello board where I break down the two first weeks sprints. It is a way for me to keep track of the things I've done and what I have left. I also made a flow chart for my backend.

**A problem I had** wasn't so much as a problem, but it took time to set it up. But I think it is necessary in order to keep to the plan and not fall behind.
