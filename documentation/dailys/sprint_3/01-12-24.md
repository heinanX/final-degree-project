**Today I worked on**
product form (and category fetching, tags fetching) - 3h
product fetching - 20min
login form - 1h
front page design - 1h



**Today I've learned more about** not so much, learnt but more like refreshed my memory. I had to work a lot with the form, and I had to figure out how I wanted to write tags and categories when I create a product through frontend. What I really wanted was an input field that predicts what you want to write if it finds a match in the tags in the database, but I realized I was spending too much time on only one component, and it's not even a major one, so I had to let it go and go with an easier option.

Categories got a selector, because I won't have that many categories, and tags got an input field that when you add one tag, it checks for that tag in the database, and if it does not exist one is created.
