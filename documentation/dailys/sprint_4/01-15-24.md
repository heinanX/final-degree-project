# START OF SPRINT 4

I've uploaded a screenshot of my board for the week. It displays the many tasks I have to finish in this week's sprint.

**I started off by** writing my retrospective. I took a snapshot of my project board and contemplated over my progress from last week in a text file - 1h 35min

**Today I worked on** 
-
- splitting the product context and creating a context each for tags and category - 35min
- single product page and details - 6h
